# Raylib Project Template - Nick Glen

Default template assumes Raylib to be installed on standard include path. \
If it isn't, either modify until it works or just ensure that raylib's library and header files are \
located on directories shown by `g++ -print-search-dirs | tr ":" "\n"` or compiler equivalent
